# Marine regions

Shapefile data for each country's Exclusive Economic Zone should be obtained by downloading v11 of the [Marine regions EEZ dataset](https://www.marineregions.org/) into this directory. For the study, version World_EEZ_v11_20191118 was
downloaded. The contents were unzipped into a directory of the same name. This
path is assumed within the code.
